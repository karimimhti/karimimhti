## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a computer science student and a system security researcher. Iâ€™m passionate about topics like OS and compiler internals, low-level development, fuzzing, binary analysis, and exploitation. I often apply mathematical principles and techniques to tackle complex security challenges and use them as a foundation for devising creative and efficient solutions.

I believe in teamwork and exchanging ideas, and Iâ€™m always ready to work on interesting and challenging projects. If you have an idea or proposal, Iâ€™d love to discuss it!

Feel free to contact me via email at karimimhti@gmail.com for inquiries, collaborations, or any other matters.
